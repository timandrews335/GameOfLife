# GameOfLife
Implementation of Conway's Game of Life

This is a VB.Net application I wrote that implements Conway's Game of Life.  This application allows user-defined options such as
background and cell colors, speed of the simulation, number of cells per axis, and number of cells which initially start the board out with.

The application is broken out into three classes:  one class for the main user interface, a class that performs the simulation and tracks the 
status of each cell, and a class which renders and displays the simulation visual for the user.

For more information on the game itself, please visit the wikipedia article for this concpet:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life
